# githubTest

This repository was created for me to get more familiar with github. I'm editing this readme with notepad on my desktop, and I should see a change to commit to the "master" on the desktop app.
Haven't yet discovered how to commit to the development branch- tbd

Hmm- updates: the commit didn't appear to keep the title and ddescription I gave it so maybe I missed something. 
Some other things to try: create a new branch and submit a merge request. Edit in the browser and pull?

Ok so I made a development branch, and its already prompting me to submit merge requests from main, so that's cool. I'll have to investigate what Tyler was saying about setting up automatic commits or something like that. Now to pull this change through the desktop app.

It worked
