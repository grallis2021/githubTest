# githubTest

This repository was created for me to get more familiar with github. I'm editing this readme with notepad on my desktop, and I should see a change to commit to the "master" on the desktop app.
Haven't yet discovered how to commit to the development branch- tbd

Hmm- updates: the commit didn't appear to keep the title and ddescription I gave it so maybe I missed something. 
Some other things to try: create a new branch and submit a merge request. Edit in the browser and pull?
